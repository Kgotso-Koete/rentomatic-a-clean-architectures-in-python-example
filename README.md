# Rentomatic

This is my implementation of the "Rent-o-Matic" project as I followed along with the book **"Clean Architectures in Python"** by Leonardo Giordani.

The goal of the project is to create a simple search engine for a room renting company using Clean Architecture principles. The system exposes a REST API and works with three types of storage systems: in-memory database, Postgres, and MongoDB.

### About the Book

The book is an excellent resource for learning how to apply clean architecture concepts in a Pythonic way.

- **Read for free**: [Clean Architectures in Python (The Digital Cat)](https://www.thedigitalcatbooks.com/pycabook-colophon/)
- **Purchase the book**: [Leanpub - Clean Architectures in Python](https://leanpub.com/clean-architectures-in-python)
- **Original Code**: [pycabook/rentomatic (GitHub)](https://github.com/pycabook/rentomatic/tree/second-edition-top)

### Requirements

This project was developed and tested with:

- **OS**: Ubuntu 24.04.3 LTS
- **Python 3.12.3**
- **docker-compose 1.29.2** (system installation)

All Python package versions are pinned in the `requirements/` folder for reproducibility.

### Credits

A huge thank you to **Leonardo Giordani** for writing such an insightful book and providing a clear path to understanding architectural patterns in Python.
